# Getting Started with Create React App

 # with using npm json-server, I'm using API on another port as
 # http://localhost:3000/users.

- and my actual project is running on http://localhost:3001.
- I've used axios library to fetch the data from an API.
- I've been using different hooks as useParams, useEffect from
react-router-dom.
- To get the data with differet id, I've used template literals
and get each users with different id.
